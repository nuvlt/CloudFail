            "[Prompt Expansion] A hyper-realistic, ultra-detailed full-body front-view depiction of Adriana Lima with no expression. She has a height of 173 cm, an ample chest with a naturally full bust (34F), a defined waist, and balanced hips. Her long, well-structured legs maintain their natural shape. Her dark brown hair is styled in a messy bun, with a few loose strands framing her face. Her flawless skin is illuminated by soft, even lighting, enhancing her natural contours without harsh shadows. She is wearing a soft bra and thong. Pose: She stands in a true full-body, head-to-toe, wide-framed, front-facing pose, ensuring her feet are flat on the ground and her entire physique from head to feet is fully visible without cropping. The camera is set at a neutral height, directly in front of her, capturing her entire height in a single frame. The background is plain and neutral, ensuring full focus on her body proportions. The soft, natural lighting enhances depth and realism while avoiding extreme contrast. Shot in HDR 4K, ultra-detailed textures, extreme photorealism, cinematic quality, with true-to-life proportions and no distortion, sharp, stunning, aesthetic, very inspirational, intricate, beautiful, innocent, symmetry, radiant, rich deep colors, perfect balance, dynamic dramatic, detailed, attractive, delicate, creative, elegant, luxury, gorgeous, fabulous, elaborate, complex\n",
